## How to use the Kobo Libra 2 without account

### Wifi ? No

At startup, the e-reader will prompt you to connect to wifi.

At this point, you should select: "Don't have wifi network?"

Then, connect the e-reader to your computer using the USB-C cable.

On the computer, the e-reader will appear as a storage device.

### Sideload

You can enable Sideloaded Mode on Kobo e-readers by adding the following code to the "ApplicationPreferences" section of the `.kobo/Kobo eReader.conf` file: `SideloadedMode=true`.

### Eject your device

When you are done, eject your device from your computer.
Reboot


## Once done, what should I do ?

### Preloaded books.

The e-reader starts up and you may notice that there are already authors and books present.

However, these cannot be accessed.

I chose to delete these entries directly in the SQLite database of the e-reader.

### How to remove Preloaded books

In the .kobo directory, there is a file called KoboReader.sqlite, which is a SQLite database.

The tables of interest are content and ShelfContent:

Take the time to familiarize yourself with the data.

```sql
-- Obtain the distinct ContentId from the ShelfContent table
select distinct ContentId from ShelfContent order by ContentId;

-- Obtain the distinct BookId from the content table
select distinct BookId from content order by bookid;

-- Obtain the content that are in the ShelfContent table
select distinct ShelfContent.ContentId, content.Bookid, content.BookTitle
from content
inner join ShelfContent on content.BookId = ShelfContent.ContentId;
```

### ðŸ’¥ Danger Zone

Here are the queries to delete the preloaded content.
It will be assumed here that no book has been manually loaded or purchased.

```sql
delete from ShelfContent
where ShelfContent.ContentId in (select content.BookId from content);

delete from content; 
```

Now preloaded books are gone.
